# Dog Vision - ML Algorithm to identify dog breeds
A Machine Learning notebook applied to identify the breed of a dog given an image of a dog.

## Problem
Some times, when you are in a bar and a nice doggo passes by, it's nice to know what dog breed is.

## Data
The data comes from Kaggle's [dog-breed-identification](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data) competition.

## Evaluation
The evaluation metric used for the competition is Multi Class Log Loss. For this competition submissions have to have a special formatting indicated [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/overview/evaluation).

## Features
Some info about the data:
* There are 120 breeds of dogs.
* Around 10k images of dogs in total.

## Link to the notebook
If you want to check the full process of transfer learning: [here is the full Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1VWK6fGaBUvDJxUStnMlc-2gYdwjv7Y7v?usp=sharing).

On the other hand, if you want to test the algorihm with you custom photo [here is the shortened notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ujRSmFBZb8ePg2JmvBo84iGkrxB2CM6q?usp=sharing) (so you don't need to train a model).

# FAQ

## You did this by yourself?
Yes and no, I follow up the course of Daniel Bourke (@mrdbourke) on ZTM Academy. So it took a while and I solved a bunch of problems in the process.

## Can I build it myself?
Of course, you need to download the data from Kaggle (~700 Mb), connect your Google Drive and do it!.

## I have another question, where can I find you?
You have different options:
* Submit an Issue,
* Send me an email at: aucacoyan@gmail.com, or
